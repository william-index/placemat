<h2 id="alternate_formats">Alternate Formats</h2>

As tables can get complex, Placemat supports some alternative formatting methods as well. Any line that begins with a tab counts as an extension of the previous line, so the table above can be rewritten as the following if desired:

{% highlight html %}
First Name
  | Last Name
  | Email
  ; This is the header row
---
Scrooge
  | McDuck
  | number1dime@example.net
  ; Email should be @moneybin, but that was taken
Launchpad  
  | McQuack
  | lpad@example.org
{% endhighlight %}

These styles can be mixed within the same file or even table if desired.
