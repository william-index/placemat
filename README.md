# Placemat

Placemat is a robust (maybe?) pre-processing language exclusively for HTML tables. This current version is 100% useless, this is just document setup to get things into version control with git, setup a huboard, and so forge

## Installation

You can install this gem:

    $ gem install placemat

## Usage

Currently Placemat will just duplicate the .plmat file it is pointed to with the .html instruction, so... dont use it. :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
