## Placemat Documents

### File Types
Placemat is an evolving file format. In the current build it is able to handle a small subset of commands. Placemat takes in .plmat files and outputs .html

## Running Placemat
Placemat runs from the terminal after installation, by simply pointing to a .plmat file. It will render an html version of that file in the working directory. the
  -c
argument passes the file name to render.

```
cd dir
placemat -c myfile.plmat
```
