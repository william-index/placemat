#About Placemat

Placemat is a robust (maybe?) pre-processing language exclusively for HTML tables.

As of V 0.2.0, Placemat can handle parsing of basic tables as well as colspan and row span. Additionally classes and ids can be added to cell level tags. For future/planned updates see tickets marked with the "0 - TODO" tag.
